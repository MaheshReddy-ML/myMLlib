# 🤖 myMLLib – Machine Learning from Scratch in Python

> **myMLLib** is a growing collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in Python.  
> The goal is to make ML concepts **clear, accessible, and customizable** — while keeping the code clean and framework-free.

Currently includes:
- 📈 **Linear Regression** (Gradient Descent)
- 📊 Metrics: **R² Score**, **MSE**
- 🎨 Built-in plotting for model fit visualization

More algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, etc.) will be added in the future 🚀

## 🌟 Features
- 📝 **Educational** – Understand ML by seeing it built from scratch
- ⚙️ **Customizable** – Choose learning rate, epochs, normalization options
- 📦 **Lightweight** – Just Python + NumPy + Matplotlib
- 🔍 **Metrics Included** – R² Score, MSE
- 📊 **Visualizations** – Plot model predictions vs actual data
