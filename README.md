# 🤖 myMLlib – Machine Learning from Scratch in Python

**myMLlib** is a growing collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in Python.  
The goal is to make ML concepts **clear, accessible, and customizable** — while keeping the code clean and framework-free.

---

## 📌 Currently Includes

### 📈 Linear Regression (Gradient Descent)
- R² Score, MSE metrics
- Optional feature/target normalization
- Plot regression fit

### 📊 Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)
- Binary Cross-Entropy (Log Loss)
- Probability prediction (`predict_proba`)
- Customizable decision threshold
- Plot loss convergence

> More algorithms (Decision Trees, KNN, Naive Bayes, etc.) coming soon 🚀

## 🌟 Features
- 📝 **Educational** – Learn ML by building it from scratch
- ⚙️ **Customizable** – Choose learning rate, epochs, normalization options, thresholds
- 📦 **Lightweight** – Requires only Python, NumPy, Matplotlib
- 🔍 **Metrics Included** – R² Score, MSE, Log Loss
- 📊 **Visualizations** – Plot regression lines & loss curves
